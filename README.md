# task_list
 UPDATE 19/06 21:30
 1. Added the ability to insert a new task using the 'Add' button.
 2. Each task is added with a bullet point which will serve as delete button if necessary.
 3. With click on the bullet point, the task will be deleted.
 Left to do - 
 1. The bullets are added to a list in the html file, but this data structure automatically adds an extra bullet point (the leftest one). Need to delete the leftest bullet point or to make it invisible using CSS. 
 2. Need to add functionality of saving button to a local file (in all html, css, and js files).
